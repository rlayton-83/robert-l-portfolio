                    So recipe cards are what cooki'n. Get your culinary<br> fix with recipe cards that help you make the<br>
                    perfect dessert or meal. <br>These cards were used to explore the use of id, and div selectors. <br> Then floating
                    and clearing them showing what css has to offer.

                <p>I began coding as a suggestion from my wife, she has a way of inspiring me to be great.<br>
                  So I listened and I am never turning back. I started as an artist and graphic designer<br>
                  who specialized in digial design.finding joy in digital drawing, printmaking, and<br>
                  graphic design. Art is my passion and now I have found a way to share it with the world.<br>
                  Through innovative design and creative thought, I can use my talents to help others experience<br>
                  the joy of watching their ideas come to life.
